This is the project page for this website. Although this is a separate GitHub repository than the one that is running the website you are on right now, I keep this GitHub link updated with the newest features I add to my personal website. 

The blog aspect of this website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll offers a lot of cool features and is extremely simple to use once you get over the small learning curve. The rest of the website Is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I started building this at the beginning of Summer 2018 and had most of it finished by September. 
I am still adding constant improvements to this website as time goes along and whenever I am not doing school work. 
My goal at the beginning of the summer was to try to learn the basics of web design so that I could eventually build a 
website like this. There are plenty of aspects that can be improved and I will do my best to update you as I learn new and better ways to design this website.
