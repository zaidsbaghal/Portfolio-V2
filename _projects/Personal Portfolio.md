Without Jekyll Integration (Just HTML Skeleton): [Github Link](https://github.com/zaidsbaghal/personal-portfolio)

This is the project page for this website. 

The Blog aspect of this website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll offers a lot of cool features and is extremely simple to use once you get over the small learning curve. The rest of the website Is built using HTML,
CSS and Javascript. 

I started building this at the beginning of Summer 2018 and had most of it finished by September. 
I am still adding constant improvements to this website as time goes along and whenever I am not doing school work. 
My goal at the beginning of the summer was to try to learn the basics of web design so that I could eventually build a 
website like this. There are plenty of places that can be improved and I will do my best to update you as I learn new and better ways to design.
