## Background

   At the beginning of Summer 2018, I had one goal in mind. I wanted my own website. I wanted to build it from scratch. I wanted it to look professional. 
And finally, I wanted the ability to blog. If you are reading this, I was able to accomplish this goal (at least partially). This post is going to be about 
the steps I took to accomplish this goal within one summer and how you can do something similar and learn how to build 
your own website/portofolio from scratch. THIS IS NOT A STEP BY STEP GUIDE. I am simply telling you the personal steps that I took in order to get what I have now. 

## Things I learned:

   * HTML and CSS
   * Basic JavaScript
   * Things to Implement
   * Jekyll and Liquid Syntax

   While the above are not necessarily difficult (especially with an introductory level computer science background) it 
comes with its unique challenges. Obviously, the hardest thing to achieve with something like this is continuous 
self-motivation. I really struggled the first 2 weeks to continuously study the material. There were definitely times 
where I wanted to give up or wanted to pull my hair out. Believe me when I say this. All you need to do on those
occasions is give up. You heard me. Give up for a few hours. If you cannot figure out how to solve a problem in 30 minutes. 
Walk away from the computer. Take a break. And try again later. It's not worth the headache. The solution is probably 
really simple and you're going to end up beating yourself up for no reason. The only reason why you haven't found the 
answer is because you have been staring at the computer for hours and are still daunted by all you have to learn. Relax 
and try again later. 
   You want to set a goal of about 3 hours a day. Granted you can do more or less as long as you stay consistent and 
do this daily. 

### HTML and CSS

   I started with a free course like the Responsive Web Design Certification on freecodecamp.com. This offered an 
excellent introduction to HTML syntax and I began to grasp things quicker and quicker. After a while you may not 
even need to finish the course as things will become very repetitive and really unnecessary to memorize. Get the basic 
syntax down and move on to your own projects. I would recommend starting with the Responsive Web Design Projects at 
the end of the course. 
   Once I completed all the projects for this course I honestly felt that I could finally learn how to build my own
site. The last project on freecodecamp.com is actually a portfolio project. You can use this as a backbone for your own site 
and build off of it. Use recourses like google and stack overflow. Don't be afraid to google questions and find answers
to the challenges you are having when implementing something. CS is unlike any other subject when learning something
as when you are struggling to understand something you can google it and look at similar things that people have built in order
to better implement your own idea. 

### Basic JavaScript

   Arguably, this isn't really necessary to build your website at all. It really depends on how complex you want to make it. Considering this was my first attempt at a website, I didn't focus on javascript for too long.
For example, the animations on the home page of my [personal website](\projects\Portfolio.md) have a very simple 
script written in JavaScript. Otherwise, this isn't really necessary for a beginner unless you aim to impress. 
It was rather easy for me to pickup as I already had a background in Java from college work. If you insist on learning I 
recommend looking up some YouTube videos on it before you attempt to write a script. Then I would google basic HTML animations
and scripts to get your feet wet and play around with your website. 

### Jekyll and Liquid Syntax

   This is where the actual blog part of the website is built. Because we are not building a blog from total scratch
we are going to use something called a Static Site Generator like Jekyll. To get started using Jekyll, you want to have 
the basic html skeleton of your website down. Once you are done with the basic skeleton you can implement Jekyll by 
following the quick start guide [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). I also used 
a [YouTube guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) just to get myself familiar 
with the liquid syntax that Jekyll uses. Once I learned the basics, I went ahead and separated my html skeleton into 
separate layouts and includes in order to make my website more fluid and continuous throughout every page. 

### Things to implement

Here are some things to consider adding to your website: 

   * Social buttons for sharing posts
   * A button to download your Resume/CV
   * A button that takes you to the top of the page
   * An archive for your blog posts
   * A navigation bar that faded from transparent to solid and is always visible when scrolling

Play around with these and use them as learning experiences.

## Conclusion

   Overall this was not a difficult thing to do. The most important thing is staying motivated and consistently working 
on your personal project daily and be willing to take a break when you need it. Consistency is key though, after taking 
a break make sure you return to your work. Always be looking to improve.
