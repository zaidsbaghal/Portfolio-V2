## Background

    At the beginning of Summer 2018 I had one goal in mind. I wanted my own website. I wanted my website to look nice. 
And finally, I wanted the ability to blog. Clearly, I was able to accomplish this goal. This post is going to be about 
the steps I took to accomplish this goal within one summer and how you can do something similar and learn how to build 
your own from scratch. THIS IS NOT A STEP BY STEP GUIDE. I am simply telling you the personal steps that I took. 

## Things I learned:

    ..* HTML and CSS
    ..* Basic JavaScript
    ..* Jekyll and Liquid Syntax

    While the above are not neccessarily difficult (especially with an introductory level computer science background) it 
comes with its unique challenges. Obviously, the hardest thing to achieve with something like this is continuous 
self-motivation. I really struggled the first 2 weeks to continuously study the material. There were definitely times 
where I wanted to give up or wanted to pull my hair out. BELEIVE ME when I say this. All you need to do on those
occasions is give up. You heard me. Give up for a few hours. If you cannot figure out how to solve a problem in 30 minutes. 
Walk away from the computer. Take a break. And try again later. It's not worth the headache. The solution is probably 
really simple and you're going to end up beating yourself up for no reason. The only reason why you haven't found the 
answer is because you have been staring at the computer for hours and are still daunted by all you have to learn. Relax 
and try again later. 
    You want to set a goal of about 3 hours a day. Granted you can do more or less as long as you stay consistent and 
do this daily. 

### HTML and CSS

     I started with a free course like the Responsive Web Design Certification on freecodecamp.com. This offered an 
excellent introduction to HTML syntax and I began to grasp things quicker and quicker. After a while you may not 
even need to finish the course as things will become very repetitive and really necessary to memorize. Get the basic 
syntax down and move on to your own projects. I would recommend starting with the Responsive Web Design Projects at 
the end of the course. 
    Once I completed all the projects for this course I honestly felt that I could finally learn how to build my own
site. The last project on freecodecamp.com is actually a portfolio project. You can use this as a backbone for your own site 
and build off of it. Use recourses like google and stack overflow. Don;t be afraid to google questions and find answers
to the challenges you are having when implementing something. CS is unlike any other subject when learning something
as when you are struggling to understand something google it and look at similar things that people have built in order
to better implement your own idea. 

### Basic JavaScript

    Arguably, this isn't really neccessary to build your website at all. It really depends on how fancy you want to make it.
For example, the animations on the home page of my [personal website](\projects\Portfolio.md) have a very simple 
script written in JavaScript. Otherwise, this isn't really necessary for a beginner unless you aim to impress. 
    It was rather easy for me to pickup as I already had a background in Java from college work. If you insist on learning I 
recommend looking up some YouTube videos on it before you attempt to write a script. Then I would google basic HTML animations
and scripts to get your feet wet and play around with your website. 

### Jekyll and Liquid Syntax

    This is where the actual blog part of the wbsite is built. Because we are not building a blog from total scratch
    we are going to use something called a Static Site Generator like Jekyll.
