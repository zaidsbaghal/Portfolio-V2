## Background

    At the beginning of Summer 2018 I had one goal in mind. I wanted my own website. I wanted my website to look nice. 
And finally, I wanted the ability to blog. Clearly, I was able to accomplish this goal. This post is going to be about 
the steps I took to accomplish this goal within one summer and how you can do something similar and learn how to build 
your own from scratch. THIS IS NOT A STEP BY STEP GUIDE. I am simply telling you the personal steps that I took. 

## Thing I learned:
    ..* HTML
    ..* CSS
    ..* Basic JavaScript
    ..* Jekyll and Liquid Syntax
    ..* Markdown

    While the above are not neccessarily difficult (especially with an introductory level computer science background) it 
comes with its unique challenges. Obviously, the hardest thing to achieve with something like this is continuous 
self-motivation. I really struggled the first 2 weeks to continuously study the material. There were definitely times 
where I wanted to give up or wanted to pull my hair out. BELEIVE ME when I say this. All you need to do on those
occasions is give up. You heard me. Give up for a few hours. If you cannot figure out how to solve a problem in 30 minutes. 
Walk away from the computer. Take a break. And try again later. It's not worth the headache. The solution is probably 
really simple and you're going to end up beating yourself up for no reason. The only reason why you haven't found the 
answer is because you have been staring at the computer for hours and are still daunted by all you have to learn. Relax 
and try again later. 
    You want to set a goal of about 3 hours a day. Granted you can do more or less as long as you stay consistent and 
do this daily. 

### HTML

     I started with a free course like the Responsive Web Design Certification on freecodecamp.com. This offered an 
excellent introduction to HTML syntax and I began to grasp things quicker and quicker. After a while you may not 
even need to finish the course as things will become very repetitive and really necessary to memorize. Get the basic 
syntax down and move on to your own projects. I would recommend starting with the Responsive Web Design Projects at 
the end of the course. 
    Once I completed all the projects for this course I honestly felt that I could finally learn how to build my own
site. From here
